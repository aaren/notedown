Create IPython Notebooks from markdown
--------------------------------------

[notedown] is a simple tool to create [IPython notebooks][ipython]
from markdown.

[ipython]: http://www.ipython.org/notebook
[notedown]: http://github.com/aaren/notedown

It is really simple and separates your markdown into code and not
code. Code goes into code cells, not-code goes into markdown cells.

Usage:

    notedown input.md > output.ipynb

Installation:

    pip install notedown

or the latest on github:

    pip install https://github.com/aaren/notedown/tarball/master


### Why?

*Save yourself* from the *indignity* of writing **text** in the browser!

There might be more reasons, but that was the main one for me.


### Magic

Fenced code blocks annotated with a language other than python are
read into cells using IPython's `%%` [cell magic][].

[cell magic]: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Cell%20Magics.ipynb

You can disable this with `--nomagic`.

- `--pre` lets you add arbitrary code to the start of the notebook.
  e.g. `notedown file.md --pre '%matplotlib inline' 'import numpy as np'`

#### R / knitr magic

- `--rmagic` will add `%load_ext rmagic` at the start of the notebook.

- `--knit` passes the markdown through [knitr] before creating a
  notebook. This requires that you have R installed with knitr.


### What notedown does **not** do:

- convert from notebook to markdown
- run code cells
- embed figures


### Conversion from notebook to markdown

Converting from an IPython notebook to markdown is done using
`nbconvert`:

    ipython nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to markdown

The IPython markdown export is currently quite basic, so you can't
expect to convert markdown -> notebook -> markdown and get back your
original markdown.


### Running an IPython Notebook

You can open the notebook in your browser with

    ipython notebook your_notebook.ipynb

and use `Cell -> Run all` in the menu.

You can run notebooks non-interactively from the command line using
[runipy]:

    pip install runipy
    runipy your_notebook.ipynb

Or, if you're using IPython 2.0:

    ipython -c "%run your_notebook.ipynb"

### This isn't very interactive!

No, it isn't. Notedown takes markdown and turns it into an IPython
notebook.

You can set up a pseudo-interactive loop in Vim by calling

```viml
:!notedown % > out.ipynb
```

and viewing the result in the browser with

```bash
ipython notebook out.ipynb
```

You'll get far better interactivity by using [vim-ipython],
which allows you to connect to a running ipython kernel. You can
send code from vim to ipython and get code completion from the
running kernel. Try it!

Here are some mappings for your vimrc to make this pleasant:
    
```viml
" Very useful mappings to be used with markdown and ipython
" search and select contents of fenced code blocks using <leader>f
nnoremap <leader>f /\v(\_^```python\n)@<=(\_.{-})(\n`{3}\_$)@=<CR>v//e<CR>
" goto the start of the current fenced code block with [b
" (see :help search)
nnoremap [b :call search('\n```python', 'b')<CR>
" select current code block with <leader>b
" TODO: assumes <leader>==, use <leader>f instead of ,f
" TODO: cancel search highlighting
nmap <leader>b [b,f
" (or could do [b0v/\n```)
" send current code block to ipython with <leader>p
nmap <leader>p ,b<C-s>
```

### I can't put a literal code block in my markdown!

Not right now, no. Notedown isn't very clever.


### Where's my syntax highlighting?!

You can syntax highlight python code contained in fenced code blocks
with this command (put it in your vimrc):

```viml
function! HiPy ()
    let b:current_syntax=''
    unlet b:current_syntax
    syntax include @py syntax/python.vim
    " github flavoured markdown (code blocks fenced with ```)
    syntax region gfmpythoncode keepend start="^```py.*$" end=/^\s*```$\n/ contains=@py
endfunction

" enable highlighting of fenced python code with <leader>h
map <leader>h :call HiPy ()<CR>
```

BONUS! Of course you can do the same for latex display and inline maths:

```viml
syntax include syntax/tex.vim
" display maths with $$ ... $$
syn region texdisplaymaths start="\$\$" end="\$\$" skip="\\\$" contains=@texMathZoneGroup
" inline maths with $ ... $
" start is a $ not preceded by another $        - \(\$\)\@<!\$
" and not preceded by a \ (concat)              - \(\$\)\@<!\&\(\\\)\@<!\$
" and not followed by another $                 - \$\(\$\)\@!
" ending in a $ not preceded by a \             - \((\$\)\@<!\$
" skipping any \$                               - \\\$
" see :help \@<! for more
syn region texinlinemaths start="\(\$\)\@<!\&\(\\\)\@<!\$\(\$\)\@!" end="\(\$\)\@<!\$" skip="\\\$" contains=@texMathZoneGroup
" restriction is that you can't have something like \$$maths$ - there
" has to be a space after all of the \$ (literal $)
```

#### Syntax highlighting with Github flavored markdown

If you are using [vim-flavored-markdown], put the following into
``after/syntax/ghmarkdown.vim``:

```viml
" Enable syntax highlighting for python code blocks in Github flavored markdown
" http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Different_syntax_highlighting_within_regions_of_a_file

if exists('b:current_syntax')
  let s:current_syntax=b:current_syntax
  unlet b:current_syntax
endif

execute 'syntax include @pythonGroup syntax/python.vim'
try
  execute 'syntax include @pythonGroup after/syntax/python.vim'
catch
  endtry

if exists('s:current_syntax')
  let b:current_syntax=s:current_syntax
else
  unlet b:current_syntax
endif

execute 'syntax cluster markdownBlock add=markdownGHPythonCodeBlock'
execute 'syntax region markdownGHPythonCodeBlock matchgroup=markdownCodeDelimiter start="^\s*$\n\s*```\s\?py\S*\s*$" end="\s*```$\n\s*\n" contained  keepend contains=@pythonGroup' 

if exists('b:current_syntax')
  let s:current_syntax=b:current_syntax
  unlet b:current_syntax
endif

execute 'syntax include syntax/tex.vim'
try
  execute 'syntax include after/syntax/tex.vim'
catch
  endtry

if exists('s:current_syntax')
  let b:current_syntax=s:current_syntax
else
  unlet b:current_syntax
endif


" display maths with $$ ... $$
execute 'syn region texdisplaymaths start="\$\$" end="\$\$" skip="\\\$" contains=@texMathZoneGroup'
" inline maths with $ ... $
" start is a $ not preceded by another $        - \(\$\)\@<!\$
" and not preceded by a \ (concat)              - \(\$\)\@<!\&\(\\\)\@<!\$
" and not followed by another $                 - \$\(\$\)\@!
" ending in a $ not preceded by a \             - \((\$\)\@<!\$
" skipping any \$                               - \\\$
" see :help \@<! for more
execute 'syn region texinlinemaths start="\(\$\)\@<!\&\(\\\)\@<!\$\(\$\)\@!" end="\(\$\)\@<!\$" skip="\\\$" contains=@texMathZoneGroup'
" restriction is that you can't have something like \$$maths$ - there
" has to be a space after all of the \$ (literal $)

" display maths with \begin{equation} ... \end{}
execute 'syn region texequationmaths start="^\s*\\begin{\(equation\|align\|gather\)\*\=}\s*$\n" keepend end="^\s*\\end{\(equation\|align\|gather\)\*\=}\s*$\n" contains=@texMathZoneGroup'

### TODO

- [x] support more markdowns
- [ ] allow other cell types?
- [x] allow different language code cells (using %%lang magic)
- [ ] allow code attributes? pass to cell creator?
- [x] code block format agnostic (fenced / indented)
